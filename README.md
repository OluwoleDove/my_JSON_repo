# my_JSON_repo
A public repo containing some key data you'll need to improve the UX of your project

To render a json file as an api, I have used the following modules.

Nodemon: Automatically restarts the server on code changes during development.
Babel: Transpiles modern JavaScript to an older version for wider compatibility.
Path: Offers tools for handling file and directory paths.
Express: Streamlines web server creation and HTTP request handling.
fs/promises: Provides promise-based file system functions for asynchronous file operations.

To install each module;
Nodemon: npm install nodemon --save-dev
Babel: npm install @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env --save-dev
Path: Path is a built-in module in Node.js, there's no need to install it.
Express: npm install express --save
fs/promises: A built-in module in Node.js, introduced in Node.js 10.0.0 - no need for installation.
